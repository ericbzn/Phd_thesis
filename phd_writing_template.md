*<u>What is the thesis problem statement?</u>*

Problems linked to computer vision applications for air vehicles are generated by the nature of the object detection task for autonomous navigation. Such missions are generally carried out in complex scenes that change as the vehicle moves through space. For example, a drone that delivers packages can start its route in a commercial area, passing through rural areas until the order is delivered within an urban area. In this case we find situations where visual information and objects suffer deformations due to changes in height and direction of the vehicle. In addition, the images captured by the drone can present strong changes in lighting and the presence of shadows that disturb the perception of a scene.

*<u>What do I (not) hope to achieve?</u>*

1. Generate a general image analysis framework for applications related with the autonomous navigation of aerial vehicles.

2. Test the framework for object detection in complex situations/scenarios such as those that may occur in applications such as autonomous navigation of air vehicles.

3. To compare qualitatively and quantitatively the detection / segmentation results of image objects with the most widely used algorithms in the literature based on deep learning techniques and with the most outstanding state-of-art methods based on traditional computer vision techniques.

*<u>What are the research questions and hypotheses?</u>*

1. Traditional computer vision methods are (still) a reliable option to develop the object detection and recognition.

2. New deep learning techniques have need of traditional computer vision methods for overcome the lack of labeled data problem.

*<u>What is my contribution to the field?</u>*

1. A new framework based on low-level image primitives that allows detection of objects in a totally unsupervised way.

2. A comparative study between the widely used image detection / segmentation techniques using deep learning architectures and traditional computer vision techniques.

3. In general terms, this thesis contributes to the debate between deep learning computer vision techniques and traditional computer vision techniques in the sense that it explores and attempts to solve highly complex problems without the need for an annotated database.

*<u>How is my thesis laid out?</u>*

Throughout this research work I used different low-level image primitives as a source of information to develop a framework for object detection and recognition. The development process of this framework was evolutionary, where each time it was added a new primitive to enrich the representation of the image. Thus, my thesis laid out follows this evolutionary process of the research work: The first part of the thesis is devoted to the study of existing contours / edges in an image. I used this information for the detection of landing paths related with the autonomous landing drone task. The second part of this document is dedicated to the study of color information in an image. This part serves as an introduction to the third part of the thesis, dedicated to the study of textures generated by the lighting changes. These two parts engage in an image search system from a query image that shows the importance of color spaces and texture in image analysis. Part number four brings together the theory used in the preceding parts to create a framework that analyzes the colors of the textures as well as the textures generated by lighting changes. In this part we show the high-level primitives that can be obtained from the proposed image representation and present a comparison between various clustering methods obtain a totally unsupervised image segmentation.
